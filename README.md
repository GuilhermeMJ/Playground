# Welcome to my code playground!

Feel free to explore my projects and anything else you find here. Enjoy the ride!

# Dev Playground v1.0

Well, everything must start from somewhere ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Let's define some kind of rules:

* Minor codes and challenges are given birth here.
* There's not much sex appeal since this space is kinda personal.
* The sex appeal may grow as these codes and challenges involve CSS.
* As projects start to grow, they will be moved to proper folders and become eligible for having their own repository. Links will pop up here as this happens.
* Everything done here must be for the sake of learning.
* Nothing is true, everything is permited.

## Vanilla Projects

* [Ginger Parking v1](./ginger-parking)

## Angular Projects

Actually you'll have to manually serve them, but here are the folders' links anyway.

* [Angular's tutorial Tour of Heroes](./tour-of-heroes)
