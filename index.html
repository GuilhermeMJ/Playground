    <h1>Dev Playground v1.0</h1>
    <p>Well, everything must start from somewhere ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
    <p>Let's define some kind of rules:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Minor codes and challenges are given birth here.</li>
      <li>There's not much sex appeal since this space is kinda personal.</li>
      <li>The sex appeal may grow as these codes and challenges involve CSS.</li>
      <li>As projects start to grow, they will be moved to proper folders and become eligible for having their own repository. Links will pop up here as this happens.</li>
      <li>Everything done here must be for the sake of learning.</li>
      <li>Nothing is true, everything is permited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vanilla Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./ginger-parking/index.html">Ginger Parking v1</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Angular Projects</h2>
    <p>Actually you'll have to manually serve them, but here are the folders' links anyway.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./tour-of-heroes">Angular's tutorial Tour of Heroes</a></li>
      <!-- <li><a href="./ginger-parking-angular">Ginger Parking v2</a></li> -->
    </ul>
