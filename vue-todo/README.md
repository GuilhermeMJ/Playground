# Vue Todo

A simple todo list powered by Vue.js and Bootstrap.

* Add/Remove tasks;
* Mark items as completed;
* Integrated with localStorage so you won't lose your list by reloading the window or closing the browser.

You can see it in action [here](https://guilhermemj.github.io/playground/vue-todo).
